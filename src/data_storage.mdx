# Data Storage

Data storage is an option that handle the way on how dante editor will hit your server to save the content, it will send an editorState serialized as JSON along with a text version. Ajax calls are made with Axios library behind the scenes.


```
data_storage: {
  success_handler: func,
  failure_handler: func,
  url: string with your endpoint
  method: "POST"
  interval: 1500,
  withCredentials: bool
  crossDomain: bool
  headers: {}
}
```

If you really really need a custom ajax call you can override the entire thing in order to integrate a custom solution with the save_handler callback.

```
data_storage: {
  save_handler: func (editorContext, content)
}
```

if you need to disable this behavior just keep this options blank
