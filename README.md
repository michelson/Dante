(This library is free and will stay free, but needs your support to sustain its development. There are lots of desirable new features and maintenance to do. If you work for a company using Dante or have the means to do so, please consider financial support)

####Just another Medium editor clone.

##Motivation:

So far I have tried all the Medium.com wysiwyg clones out there, these are really great, and each have their pros and cons. [But none of them has all the features that the real medium editor provides.](http://howtox.com/medium-editor-clones-in-js/)
so I wonder, How complicated could it be to write my own Medium wysiwyg clone?

## Demo:

[http://michelson.github.io/Dante/](http://michelson.github.io/Dante/)

Until now I´ve been able to implement the following features:

## Features:

+ HTML sanitizer for pasted or loaded text.
+ Image upload for paste events.
+ Image upload for legacy images on existent texts.
+ The medium (+) Tooltip to embed or upload media.
+ Tab navigation.
+ Embeds:
  + Image Uploader with *preview* and caption option.
  + Embed data for pasted link through OEmbed services.
  + Embed media information for pasted links through OEmbed services.
  + Add or remove tooltip buttons with ease with plugin system.
+ Suggest data when type @
+ List creation with shorcuts ie:. 1. , - , 1) with spacebar or return key
+ Custom tooltip bottons support
+ CSS tries to use the same fonts used in Medium, (if you have already setup those fonts) or fallbacks to open fonts (by Google fonts) or system fonts.
  + serif: freight-text-pro fallbacks to Merriweather or Georgia,
  + sans:  jaf-bernino-sans fallbacks to Open Sans or Lucida Grande


## Usage:

### HTML on new.html.erb:

```html
  <div id="editor">
    your content here
  </div>
```

### Javascript on new.html.erb:

```html
  <script type="text/javascript">
    editor = new Dante.Editor(
      {
        el: "#editor",
        upload_url: "/images.json", //it expect an url string in response like /your/server/image.jpg or http://app.com/images/image.jpg
        store_url: "/save" //post to save

      }
    );
    editor.start()
  </script>
```

### Ruby:

Dante sends params from the view to the controller within a "body" key, with the HTML (in string form) as the value. 
With Rails' strong params, you will need to rename it to whatever that method will accept. To post
successfully to the controller, you will probably need to modify the params within the "create" action. 
For example, if you had a resource called "Story", with each Story having 1 text field called "content",
you would rename and merge the params like so:

```ruby
  def create
    story = {:story => {:content => params[:body]}}
    params.merge!(story)
    @story = Story.new(story_params)

    respond_to do |format|
      if @story.save
        format.html { redirect_to @story, notice: 'Story was successfully created.' }
        format.json { render :show, status: :created, location: @story }
      else
        format.html { render :new }
        format.json { render json: @story.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }
      end
    end
  end
```
### HTML on the show.html.erb page:

  <%= @story.content.html_safe %>
```
