####Just another Medium editor clone.

##Motivation:

So far I have tried all the Medium.com wysiwyg clones out there, these are really great, and each have their pros and cons. [But none of them has all the features that the real medium editor provides.](http://howtox.com/medium-editor-clones-in-js/)
so I wonder, How complicated could be write my own Medium wysiwyg clone?

## Demo:

[http://michelson.github.io/Dante/](http://michelson.github.io/Dante/)

Until now IÂ´ve been able to implement the following features:

## Features:

+ HTML sanitizer for pasted or loaded text.
+ Image upload for paste events.
+ Image upload for legacy images on existent texts.
+ The medium (+) Tooltip to embed or upload media.
+ Tab navigation.
+ Embeds:
  + Image Uploader with *preview* and caption option.
  + Embed data for pasted link through OEmbed services.
  + Embed media information for pasted links through OEmbed services.
+ List creation with shorcuts ie:. 1. , - , 1) with spacebar or return key
+ CSS tries to use the same fonts used in Medium, (if you have already setup those fonts) or fallbacks to open fonts (by Google fonts) or system fonts.
  + serif: freight-text-pro fallbacks to Merriweather or Georgia,
  + sans:  jaf-bernino-sans fallbacks to Open Sans or Lucida Grande
