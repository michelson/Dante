Bright blue cartooniness aside, he’s more or less a prescient version of our President-elect.Sure, there are also some parallels here to Italy’s Five Star Movement, a growing, far-right political party started by a comedian who got crowds of malcontent Italians to shout “Fuck off!” at corrupt politicians. And yes, the circumstances under which Waldo enters the race stem from an Anthony Weiner-esque sexting scandal that forces an incumbent politician to step out of office. But Waldo’s rise to power eerily mirrors Donald Trump’s, especially considering that this episode of Black Mirror was penned long before there were any signs that Trump might actually secure the presidency in 2016.Waldo, like Trump, begins as a candidate perceived as a joke, only to win the favor of voters who enjoy his lack of filter and “refreshing” sincerity. Waldo, too, makes for good entertainment, and that’s enough to get him votes. The episode’s final scene, in which the cartoon bear reigns as global dictator and wields what appears to be a brutal police regime, now reads as a dark foreshadowing of what might come out of a Trump presidency—and it’s not funny at all.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":0,"length":22,"style":"BOLD"},{"offset":908,"length":12,"style":"ITALIC"}],"entityRanges":[{"offset":475,"length":18,"key":0}],"data":{}},{"key":"2udte","text":"Nosedive (season 3, episode 1)","type":"header-four","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":0,"length":30,"style":"BOLD"}],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"9p0jl","text":"","type":"image","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{"enabled":false,"aspect_ratio":{"width":800,"height":401,"ratio":50.125},"width":800,"height":401,"forceUpload":false,"url":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VSYQZNBOryr5kxstmUKGKg.jpeg","loading_progress":0,"selected":false,"loading":false,"file":null,"direction":"center"}},{"key":"26fqh","text":"In the world of this episode, rating friends, coworkers, service workers, and even passersby is standard practice, and those crucial ratings determine everything from your career trajectory to your rent.

One company has gone even further: Peeple endeavored to offer a rating system for people, regardless of whether they consented to be included. After the app was eviscerated by the press, it launched this March as a watered-down, opt-in version of the original concept.

Each day, the most hated person on the internet faces a grisly death at the hands of hacked drone bees, thousands of which have been deployed as a solution to the bee-killing Colony Collapse Disorder. Though no furious social media mob in our current world has yet managed to commit murder, the tools for viral outrage are amply abused: Death threats run amok on the internet, and public outrage has managed to end careers and ruin lives. (See, for example, the stories of Justine Sacco and Lindsey Stone, who faced job-ending public shame after making misguided—but, in the grand scheme of things, fairly innocuous— posts to social media.)And those autonomous drone bees? A team at Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has been developing them for over a decade (and will hopefully make them as unhackable as possible). Autonomous Flying Microrobots, or RoboBees, are intended for potential use in cross-pollination, search and rescue missions, and surveillance.Speaking of surveillance, that’s another theme Black Mirror manages to pack into this episode: The drone bees have also been covertly conscripted by the British government to monitor the nation. In the real world, multiple municipalities across the country have adopted surveillance drones; notably, the ACLU recently found that the FBI had employed them in Baltimore during the protests over Freddie Gray’s killing. Mass surveillance—much like online abuse and robotic drone bees—is a reality. All that keeps this episode from becoming prescient documentary is a vigilante hacker coopting these forces to make a twisted public statement.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":0,"length":16,"style":"BOLD"},{"offset":1107,"length":12,"style":"ITALIC"}],"entityRanges":[{"offset":256,"length":24,"key":4},{"offset":539,"length":46,"key":5},{"offset":952,"length":8,"key":6},{"offset":1322,"length":27,"key":7}],"data":{}},{"key":"28ekg","text":"Entire History of You (season 1, episode 3)","type":"header-four","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":0,"length":43,"style":"BOLD"}],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"agdh8","text":"","type":"header-four","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"dido0","text":"","type":"image","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{"enabled":false,"aspect_ratio":{"width":800,"height":401,"ratio":50.125},"width":800,"height":401,"forceUpload":false,"url":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gJkyxh7jfu5hEgs6QJxnyA.jpeg","loading_progress":0,"selected":false,"loading":false,"file":null,"direction":"center"}},{"key":"6uhib","text":"In this episode’s world, most people sport a “Grain” — an implant and interactive contact lens system that allows them to record every moment of their lives and replay at will. It’s Google Glass on steroids, shrunk down and stuck inside our eyeballs. That technology is in the works: Google recently patented a smart contact lens that could wirelessly send data to any internet-connected device; similarly, Samsung and Sony have each patented smart contact lenses that could double as cameras. In “Entire History of You,” people also curate their Grains like you might selectively edit your social feeds today: on the Grain, you can get rid of an unsavory memory (like deleting a painful “On This Day” notification from Facebook) or replay one of your “greatest hits,” much as you might scroll your Instagrams of a particularly enjoyable trip.Meticulously recording one’s life in real time predates the futuristic lenses featured in this episode. In 1978, for instance, Steve Mann began developing a prosthetic that allowed his eye to function as both a camera and a TV display; in the early aughts, Gordon Bell similarly experimented with “lifelogging,” wearing a camera that took a photo every 30 seconds. Y Combinator partner Justin Kan has also been a prominent practitioner of this type of self-surveillance: For eight months in 2007 he streamed every moment of his life before shutting down that experiment and starting up the popular live-streaming service Twitch. Of course, beyond a few experimental technologists, it’s unclear whether the broader public wants real-time documentation of their every moment—and Black Mirror’s take is a pretty harrowing campaign against it.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":0,"length":24,"style":"BOLD"},{"offset":1564,"length":5,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":1620,"length":13,"style":"ITALIC"}],"entityRanges":[{"offset":300,"length":29,"key":8},{"offset":407,"length":7,"key":9},{"offset":419,"length":4,"key":10},{"offset":1433,"length":37,"key":11}],"data":{}},{"key":"1qnu1","text":"Playtest (season 3, episode 2)","type":"header-four","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":0,"length":30,"style":"BOLD"}],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"e37e8","text":"","type":"image","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{"enabled":false,"aspect_ratio":{"width":800,"height":401,"ratio":50.125},"width":800,"height":401,"forceUpload":false,"url":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bPQ7oBPEOg0ISwLUnsjLSw.jpeg","loading_progress":0,"selected":false,"loading":false,"file":null,"direction":"center"}},{"key":"bfgin","text":"“Playtest” follows wanderlust-stricken Cooper (Wyatt Russell) as he offers himself as a test subject for an augmented reality horror game—an experiment that turns fatal.

The game he ends up playing is a mix of Pokémon Go and the myriad other augmented reality games out there; it also draws from biofeedback-enhanced games, such as Nevermind, which read players’ stress levels and adjust gameplay accordingly.But what really brings the terror in “Playtest” is that the game uses a neural net to learn and build on the player’s worst fears. For Cooper, those include spiders, a deranged doppelgänger of his recent hookup, and his mother suffering from Alzheimer’s. It’s a terrifying version of that 2010 Arcade Fire music video, which used Google Maps and html5 to set the video in the viewer’s childhood neighborhood.

As it turns out, the “roaches” aren’t zombies at all—they’re average people deemed “undesirable” by some greater political power that’s running a eugenics program. An augmented reality system, fed by the soldiers’ neural implants, makes these people look inhuman—think Snap lenses, projected onto your eyeballs without your explicit consent.The point of the implant is to reduce the soldiers’ empathy, eliminating PTSD by allowing them to kill off vulnerable populations without guilt. It works—that is, until a virus infects Stripe’s implant, letting him see that he’s unknowingly killing off innocent people. The idea that we could rid soldiers of empathy is chilling, and in many ways these soldiers seem like the logical progression of projects such as the US military’s Nett Warrior and France’s “Future Soldier” programs, which equip troops with high-tech communications systems. Most notably, however, this episode seems like a parable of what right-wing Trump-fueled nationalism and xenophobia might bring about—technology only aids in the mission.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":0,"length":35,"style":"BOLD"}],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"6uprp","text":"San Junipero (season 3, episode 4 )","type":"header-four","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":0,"length":35,"style":"BOLD"}],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"48kt0","text":"","type":"image","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{"enabled":false,"aspect_ratio":{"width":800,"height":401,"ratio":50.125},"width":800,"height":401,"forceUpload":false,"url":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*exG3QaU4M3UcKyBfzEjkEA.jpeg","loading_progress":0,"selected":false,"loading":false,"file":null,"direction":"center"}},{"key":"c5v9","text":"In this episode, people can live forever in virtual reality by uploading their consciousnesses after death.

We’re certainly not there yet—though initiatives to better understand the science of the human brain, like the Human Brain Project, are nudging us closer.What makes this episode particularly powerful is its protagonist’s motivations for prematurely “crossing over” to the virtual afterlife. Now elderly, Yorkie (Mackenzie Davis) has been paralyzed since 21, and for her, San Junipero isn’t an afterlife so much as a chance at fully experiencing life itself. It echoes the ways that many people with disabilities engage with virtual worlds such as Second Life and InWorldz, living there in ways they can’t in the physical world. We may be a long way from coding a virtual heaven, but the concept of virtual realities allowing people to broaden their life experiences isn’t fiction at all.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":0,"length":16,"style":"BOLD"}],"entityRanges":[{"offset":341,"length":19,"key":20}],"data":{}},{"key":"egdol","text":"The National Anthem (season 1, episode 1)","type":"header-four","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":0,"length":41,"style":"BOLD"}],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"3sc3e","text":"","type":"image","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{"enabled":false,"aspect_ratio":{"width":800,"height":401,"ratio":50.125},"width":800,"height":401,"forceUpload":false,"url":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uXZdF0yUsRAnqZ66Jg89EA.jpeg","loading_progress":0,"selected":false,"loading":false,"file":null,"direction":"center"}},{"key":"f2fqe","text":"In Black Mirror’s cringe-worthy pilot, Britain’s princess has been kidnapped and will only be released if the Prime Minister has sex with a pig on live television.

Indeed, the world it portrays is so similar to ours that it even bears coincidental resemblance to the tabloid-fueled “Piggate” rumors that erupted last fall (years after the episode premiered) accusing then-Prime Minister David Cameron of inserting his genitals in a dead pig’s mouth.

It turns out that the scenario is meant to be a fitting punishment: Victoria is being made to relive this nightmare after helping her boyfriend kidnap and murder a young girl, filming it all on her cell phone. Victoria’s story is loosely modeled on the Moors murders: Ian Brady and Myra Hindley abducted and murdered five children, earning Hindley the title of “most evil woman in Britain” (though in real life, the murderers were not punished by public torture or repeated memory wiping).Before this episode’s third-act twist, it appears to be making a statement about our tendency to disappear into our devices rather than experiencing the world firsthand (see: photos of hundreds of cell phone-wielding New Yorkers documenting Manhattanhenge). It then becomes clear that the people with the cell phones aren’t zombies at all, but rather attendees at the theme park that is the protagonist’s torture chamber. They’ve been told to film her, but ignore her pleas for help, mirroring Victoria’s own actions as she filmed her victim’s torture.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":0,"length":33,"style":"BOLD"}],"entityRanges":[{"offset":498,"length":5,"key":22},{"offset":810,"length":6,"key":23}],"data":{}},{"key":"e7nlc","text":"","type":"image","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{"enabled":false,"aspect_ratio":{"width":800,"height":14,"ratio":1.7500000000000002},"width":800,"height":14,"forceUpload":false,"url":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GpmBzpGpmYrfDNiqABzipw.png","loading_progress":0,"selected":false,"loading":false,"file":null,"direction":"center"}},{"key":"9f7el","text":"Are you, too, turning to the dystopian world of Black Mirror as a dark oracle of things to come?
